He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Ernest's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."
