One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDustin was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Dustin put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Dustin's test show?\nA. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00b0C. Nolan wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00b0C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nWhich of the following could Nolan's test show?\nA. how well the weather station would work when it was windy\nB. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Over time, the hairs of their coats lose their original color and become gray or white.\nIn a group of horses, some individuals have coat graying and others do not. In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two horses.\nWhat is the expected ratio of offspring that have coat graying to offspring that do not have coat graying?

When this happens, the lionesses help raise each other's cubs. The lionesses work together to feed and protect all the cubs for about two years.\nLionesses have to protect their cubs from male lions that are not part of their pride. These male lions may attack and kill the cubs to try to take over the pride. When a pride has multiple lionesses, the cubs are less likely to be killed in an attack.

The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Leroy thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nWhich of the following could Leroy's test show?\nA. how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\nB. if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second\nC. how much athletes would sweat in the fabric\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDonald was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00b0C. Donald wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00b0C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nWhich of the following could Donald's test show?\nA. how well the weather station would work when it was windy\nB. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

These grasses crowded out other plants. Dr. Gilbert thought that she could use fire to remove the unwanted grasses and allow other plants to grow. But she didn't know how often the prairie should be burned.\nDr. Gilbert marked off six plots within a large area of the prairie. She used carefully controlled fires to burn all of the plants in each plot. She burned three of the plots once a year for three years. She burned the other three plots twice a year for three years. A year after the last fire, Dr. Gilbert counted the number of unwanted grasses in each of the six plots.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nEuropean earwigs are small insects that raise their offspring in cool, moist soil. After earwigs mate, females lay their eggs in underground nests. Females often groom, or clean, their eggs. The females lick their eggs and turn them over in the nest to groom them.\nWhen female earwigs groom eggs, the eggs hatch more often. This is because grooming helps to remove mold from the surface of the eggs. Mold often lives in the soil around the nest and can infect and kill the eggs.\nFigure: a female European earwig caring for her eggs.\nWhy might grooming eggs increase the reproductive success of a female European earwig? Complete the claim below that answers this question and is best supported by the passage.\nGrooming eggs increases the chances that ().\nA. the female will spend time near her offspring\nB. the female will produce more eggs\nC. the female's offspring will survive\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

When a population inhabits an environment with abundant resources and few limiting factors, it can experience exponential growth. Under these conditions, a population grows increasingly rapidly. Plotted on a graph with time on the x-axis and population size on the y-axis, exponential growth resembles a J-shaped curve. Logistic growth, in contrast, occurs when resources are scarce or a population faces considerable limiting factors, such as predators. Logistic growth resembles an S-shaped curve: it rises steeply at first but then levels off. When growth levels off, the population has reached the environment's carrying capacity, or the population limit it can support.\nWhich term matches the picture?\nA. logistic growth\nB. exponential growth\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRoger was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Roger put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour.

Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nBaboons are found in many parts of Africa, where they live in groups. Female baboons in a group can form social bonds, or close relationships, with other females. Most female baboons form social bonds, but some have stronger bonds than others. Females that have stronger social bonds spend more time grooming, or cleaning, each other.\nWhen a female has strong social bonds with other females, more of her offspring reach adulthood than the offspring of females with weak social bonds. This may be because having strong social bonds helps a female handle stress. When female baboons are stressed, the females that have strong social bonds spend more time together. This makes the females less stressed, which can also help their offspring.\nFigure: baboons grooming one another.\nWhy might forming strong social bonds with other females increase the reproductive success of a female baboon? Complete the claim below that answers this question and is best supported by the passage.\nForming strong social bonds with other females increases the chances that ().\nA. the female's offspring will live longer\nB. the female will spend more time grooming other baboons\nC. the female's offspring will be around other females\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSanjay was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00b0C. Sanjay wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00b0C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nWhich of the following could Sanjay's test show?\nA. how well the weather station would work when it was windy\nB. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nChase, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Chase thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nWhich of the following could Chase's test show?\nA. if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second\nB. how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\nC. how much athletes would sweat in the fabric\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

The daytime sky becomes dark as sunlight is blotted out. Is it a terrible thunderstorm? No, it's actually a flock of thousands of passenger pigeons zooming overhead! Hundreds of years ago, there were three to five billion passenger pigeons in America, and the incredible sight of a flock's flight was a regular event. Sadly, passenger pigeons are extinct. None are left today.\nPassenger pigeons were a migratory bird. Migratory birds move about from season to season searching for places to nest and feed. The passenger pigeon migration ranged from Canada all the way to Texas and Florida. During a migration, thousands of birds would fly together from morning to night for several days. People reported seeing flocks as large as a mile wide! The migrations took place in spring and fall, when warmer weather brought forests to life with fresh food sources like nuts, seeds, berries, and insects.\nAt first, it seemed as though passenger pigeons were an endless supply of tasty meat. When a massive flock passed by, hunters could easily catch a few passenger pigeons without affecting the others. But later, hunters would travel to find nesting sites. A passenger pigeon nesting site might contain over one million birds. The birds usually nested close together, and hunters found them to be easy targets.\nEventually this overhunting destroyed the pigeon population. The last known passenger pigeon in the world died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden in 1914. The pigeon, named Martha, was twenty-nine years old. Although the extinction of the passenger pigeon is a terrible loss, it did have one happy result: it pushed people to create wildlife protection laws to protect other creatures from a similar fate.\nBased on the text, which of the following things made the passenger pigeon migration a special event?\nA. The migration caused warmer weather and forest growth.\nB. Only people in Florida and Texas could see the migration.\nC. The migration only happened every one hundred years.\nD. The sun was blocked out by huge flocks of birds.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nTrevor was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00b0C. Trevor wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00b0C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nWhich of the following could Trevor's test show?\nA. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C\nB. how well the weather station would work when it was windy\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nJerry was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00b0C. Jerry wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00b0C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nWhich of the following could Jerry's test show?\nA. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C\nB. how well the weather station would work when it was windy\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSteven was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Steven put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Steven's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Rick thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design.\nWhich of the following could Rick's test show?\nA. if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design\nB. which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area\nC. which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.\nIn a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for not having myotonia congenita (m) is recessive to the allele for having myotonia congenita (M).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two goats.\nWhat is the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita?

To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nWhich of the following could Isabelle and Kayla's test show?\nA. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry\nB. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Edgar compared the average number of pure water drops to the average number of water drops mixed with hand soap that he could add to a penny before the water spilled over.\nFigure: a dome of water on the surface of a penny.\nIdentify the question that Edgar's experiment can best answer.\nA. Can pennies hold more drops of pure water or water mixed with hand soap?\nB. Can pennies hold more drops of water mixed with dish soap or water mixed with hand soap?\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Endotherms, such as humans and other mammals, can regulate their temperatures internally. When the temperature of their surrounding environments changes, endotherms may shiver or sweat to keep their body temperatures within a normal range.\nFor ectotherms, by contrast, a change in the temperature of the surrounding environment will usually affect the animal's body temperature. Ectotherms often regulate their body temperatures by moving within their environments; for instance, a lizard will lie out in the sun to warm itself up.\nWhich term matches the picture?\nA. endotherms\nB. ectotherms\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nScott was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Scott put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Scott's test show?\nA. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nB. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nC. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Pete put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Pete's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.\n\nMany types of bacteria cannot survive on objects made of copper. Dr. Bennett was considering using beds with copper bed rails instead of beds with plastic rails at the hospital where she worked. She wanted to know if copper bed rails would reduce the number of patients who got new infections.\nTo test this, Dr. Bennett had beds with copper rails placed in half of the hospital rooms. Over the next six months, 430 patients were admitted to the hospital: 215 patients were put in rooms with copper bed rails and 215 patients were put in rooms with plastic bed rails. Dr. Bennett counted the number of patients in each type of room who got new infections while they were in the hospital.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.\nFigure: a hospital bed with plastic bed rails.\nWhich of the following was a dependent variable in this experiment?\nA. the type of bed rail\nB. the number of patients who got new infections\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Some other mammalian species, though, are ruminants, which means that their stomachs have four chambers instead of one. Ruminants are perhaps most well-known for how much chewing they do during their digestive process. When a ruminant, such as a deer, eats food, the first two chambers of the animal's stomach extract the liquid from the food. The solid remainder of the food, known as the cud, is then regurgitated back into the animal's mouth to be chewed again. This allows the animal to extract more nutrients than it would otherwise. This is ideal for animals that eat plant-based diets, so it's no coincidence that ruminants are always herbivores.\nWhich term matches the picture?\nA. ruminant\nB. monogastric\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.\n\nDominic designed an electric circuit to test how well different types of metal conduct electricity. The circuit included a battery, a light bulb, wires, and clips that could be attached to a sheet of metal. If the metal conducted electricity poorly, the light bulb would appear dim. If the metal conducted electricity well, the light bulb would appear bright.\nDominic collected nine equally sized sheets of metal: three sheets of copper, three sheets of iron, and three sheets of aluminum. He used the clips to attach each metal sheet, one sheet at a time, to the circuit. For each sheet, Dominic used a light meter to measure how much light the bulb produced.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.\nFigure: clips attached to a sheet of copper in a circuit.\nWhich of the following was a dependent variable in this experiment?\nA. the amount of light produced by the light bulb\nB. the type of metal sheet used in the circuit\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

When a human with Thomsen disease first contracts a resting muscle, the muscle is slow to relax and may stay contracted for a while. But after repeated use, the muscle can contract and relax normally. This is known as the warm-up effect.\nIn a group of humans, some individuals have Thomsen disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles. The allele for not having Thomsen disease (m) is recessive to the allele for having Thomsen disease (M).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two humans.\nWhat is the probability that a human produced by this cross will not have Thomsen disease?\nA. 3/4\nB. 4/4\nC. 1/4\nD. 0/4\nE. 2/4\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nShivani was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Shivani wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.\nSo, Shivani put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.\nFigure: a drone without blade guards.\nWhich of the following could Shivani's test show?\nA. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards\nB. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly\nC. if the blade guards would break in a crash\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nJordan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Jordan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Jordan's test show?\nA. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nB. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nC. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nBen, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Ben thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nWhich of the following could Ben's test show?\nA. how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\nB. if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second\nC. how much athletes would sweat in the fabric\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nAmazonian poison frogs live in tropical forests in northern South America. After a male and female frog mate, the female frog lays eggs on a plant. When tadpoles hatch from the eggs, the male frog lets the tadpoles climb onto his back. The male then searches for water trapped in the spaces where plants' leaves meet their stems. He puts his tadpoles in these small pools of water.\nIf the male frog puts a tadpole into a pool with a larger tadpole, the smaller tadpole is often eaten. So, the male frog usually puts each tadpole into a pool of water that does not have other tadpoles in it.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSandeep was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sandeep put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Sandeep's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nWhich of the following could Lacey and Kathleen's test show?\nA. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use\nB. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Corals may look like rocks or plants, but they are actually structures made up of living animals and can grow over time.\nCorals provide shelter for fish, crabs, eels, and many other organisms. These coral reef organisms are prey for larger animals, such as sea turtles, sharks, and dolphins. Most of these organisms need tropical coral reefs in order to survive and reproduce.\n\nFigure 1: a tropical coral reef.\n\nFigure 2: several types of corals.\nWhich of the following is a characteristic of tropical coral reefs?\nA.

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Hakim put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Hakim's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Before a carp is cooked, its scales are usually removed. Normally, carp are covered in small scales arranged in straight rows. But carp with mirror scales have large scales arranged in scattered patches. Because mirror scales do not cover the fish's entire body, carp with mirror scales are easier to prepare for cooking.\nIn a group of common carp, some individuals have normal scales and others have mirror scales. In this group, the gene for the scale type trait has two alleles. The allele for normal scales (A) is dominant over the allele for mirror scales (a).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two common carp.\nWhat is the expected ratio of offspring with mirror scales to offspring with normal scales?

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nAnita was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Anita wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.\nSo, Anita put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.\nFigure: a drone without blade guards.\nWhich of the following could Anita's test show?\nA. if the blade guards would break in a crash\nB. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards\nC. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nJeremiah was installing solar panels on the roof of a client's house. The panels had to provide enough electricity to power the house year-round. Jeremiah needed to decide how many panels to install and which side of the roof to install them on. If he put the panels on the side that got the most sun, then he could use fewer panels, and the client would save money. Jeremiah installed sunlight sensors on both sides of the roof. Then, he measured the amount of sunlight the sensors on each side of the roof recorded over one sunny summer day.\nFigure: installing solar panels on a roof.\nWhich of the following could Jeremiah's test show?\nA. the amount of sunlight the roof would get throughout the year\nB. which side of the roof got more sun over one day\nC. how many solar panels could fit on each side of the roof\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.\n\nKaty liked to make guacamole, but she could often find only unripe  at the grocery store. In biology class, Katy learned that ripe fruits produce a gas called ethylene that can cause other fruits to ripen. Katy wondered whether storing ripe bananas with unripe  would make the  ripen faster.\nKaty prepared four paper bags with five unripe  in each bag. She added one ripe banana to two of the bags and no bananas to the remaining two bags. Then, Katy sealed all four bags. After three days, she opened each bag and counted the number of ripe  in each bag.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.\nFigure: avocados.\nWhich of the following was an independent variable in this experiment?\nA. the number of ripe bananas\nB. the number of ripe avocados\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

She wanted to design a new turbine that would produce 10% more electricity than older wind turbines. She thought that a turbine made from lightweight material would turn more easily and produce more electricity. So, Erica created a computer model of a turbine made from lightweight material. Then she used the model to calculate how much more electricity the new turbine could produce compared to the older turbines.\nFigure: studying a wind turbine computer model.\nWhich of the following could Erica's test show?\nA. how much the new turbine would weigh\nB. whether the new turbine could produce 10% more electricity\nC. if the new turbine could turn easily\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nBlunthead cichlids (SIK-lids) are fish that live in Lake Tanganyika in Eastern Africa. After a female blunthead cichlid lays eggs, she holds the eggs in her mouth. Once they hatch, her young fish live in her mouth until they are old enough to survive on their own. This process, called mouthbrooding, takes about six weeks.\nWhile mouthbrooding, the female cichlid catches algae from the lake. But she does not swallow any. Instead, she feeds the algae to her offspring by holding it in her mouth for the offspring to eat. By eating the algae, the offspring grow larger and become faster swimmers that can escape predators more quickly.\nFigure: a blunthead cichlid.\nWhy might feeding offspring during mouthbrooding increase the reproductive success of a female blunthead cichlid?

She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Jenny wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.\nSo, Jenny put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.\nFigure: a drone without blade guards.\nWhich of the following could Jenny's test show?\nA. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards\nB. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly\nC. if the blade guards would break in a crash\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.\nIn a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for not having myotonia congenita (m) is recessive to the allele for having myotonia congenita (M).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two goats.\nWhat is the probability that a goat produced by this cross will not have myotonia congenita?\nA. 4/4\nB. 2/4\nC. 1/4\nD. 0/4\nE. 3/4\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nOlivia and Kayla were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nWhich of the following could Olivia and Kayla's test show?\nA. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry\nB. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCooper was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Cooper put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Cooper's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Dean put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nBlack-headed gulls build their nests on the ground. The gulls' eggs, chicks, and nests are brown, so they blend in with the sand, twigs, and dry grass around them. But the inside of a gull's eggshell is white. When an egg hatches, the white of the broken eggshell stands out from the brown nest. This makes it easier for crows and other predators to find the nest and eat the offspring in it.\nAfter an egg hatches, the parent gull leaves the nest to carry the broken eggshell away. This helps the nest blend in with the environment again. It is harder for predators to find offspring in a nest that blends in with the environment.\nFigure: a black-headed gull carrying a broken eggshell.\nWhy might removing broken eggshells from the nest increase the reproductive success of a black-headed gull?

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nOwen was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Owen put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Owen's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.\nFor example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world.\nBased on the text, how does a sloth's fur help protect it?\nA. A sloth's fur protects its important organs.\nB. A sloth's fur helps it hide from predators.\nC. A sloth's fur helps it cling to tree branches.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Josiah thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample.

Believe it or not, the oceans contain a lizard-like creature called the blue glaucus or blue dragon. However, these \"dragons\" are not the fire-breathing beasts of fantasy. In fact, they are only about an inch long. Blue dragons are a type of sea slug.\nAlthough these slugs are cuter than legendary dragons, you shouldn't let their squishy bodies fool you. These tiny creatures can be dangerous! Blue dragons eat poisonous sea creatures, such as Portuguese man-of-wars. The blue dragons store their prey's venom in their many \"fingers.\" They can then use that stored poison to defend themselves. So, never touch a blue dragon\u2014unless you want to get a painful and possibly serious sting.\nBlue dragons have another way to stay safe from predators. They float on their backs so their bright blue bellies point upward. The blue blends in with the water, making it hard for predators flying overhead to see them. And predators swimming below will have trouble spotting the dragons' gray backs. The light color blends with the sunlight shining down through the water. This two-color effect is called countershading, and it's a good way to avoid getting eaten!\nYou might see blue dragons washed up on some beaches, but they usually drift on warm surfaces of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. An air bubble in their stomach allows them to float for long periods of time. It is difficult for scientists to find these tiny creatures in the vast oceans. So, there is still much we don't know about them. What we do know, though, is that these beautiful dragons are full of surprising traits.\nBased on the text, why are blue dragons dangerous?\nA.

The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Eli thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nWhich of the following could Eli's test show?\nA. how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\nB. how much athletes would sweat in the fabric\nC. if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\nWhich sentence correctly describes capybaras?\nA. They are shy animals that usually hide in tall grass.\nB. They are wild guinea pigs that live in mountain forests.\nC. They are the closest relatives of the hippopotamus.\nD. They are large rodents that are powerful swimmers.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nJackson, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Jackson thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nWhich of the following could Jackson's test show?\nA. how much athletes would sweat in the fabric\nB. how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\nC. if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nFranklin was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Franklin put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Franklin's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.\n\nPablo wanted to grow cucumbers from seeds. He read that using a heating pad to heat up potting soil could help make seeds germinate, or sprout, faster. Pablo wondered whether the temperature of the heating pad would affect how quickly the seeds germinated.\nPablo prepared two potting trays, each made up of ten small pots of soil. He planted one cucumber seed in each small pot and arranged the potting trays near a sunny window. He set an electric heating pad to 75\u00b0F and placed it under one potting tray. He set a second heating pad to 85\u00b0F and placed it under the other potting tray. Pablo observed the pots daily, and he counted the number of days it took until a seed germinated in each pot.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.\nFigure: germinating plants in a potting tray.\nWhich of the following was an independent variable in this experiment?\nA. the number of days until a seed germinated\nB. the temperature of the heating pad\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nLeon was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00b0C. Leon wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00b0C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nWhich of the following could Leon's test show?\nA. how well the weather station would work when it was windy\nB. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."

In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nBased on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nA. They can \"talk\" directly to one other fruit bat.\nB. They can understand some human speech.\nC. They can communicate with many kinds of animals.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly."
